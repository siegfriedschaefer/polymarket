# Testing application

- python infrastructure is running
- redis was not installed, installed it manually by running docker installation
- celery tasks were created, but polymarket api did not work because of get_positions() call which was not provided by ClobClient.
  get_positions() should track the current portfolio state, but this is not provided by Polymarket.

## To Do

- asked Claude to implement Portfolio tracking functionality as an independant class, to be used for other assets.
  Claude implemented portfolio - class
